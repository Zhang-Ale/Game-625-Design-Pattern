# Game-625-Design-Pattern
Pacman game where you can kill enemies. 


**Team:**
*Jacob, 
*HongCheng


**How to play:** 
Move your character around with the WASD keys and shoot the enemies with bullets. 



**Unique skill: "SHOTGUN".**

Skill description: your gun can turn into a shotgun for 10 seconds and shoot multiple bullets. Press R to reload the bullets to shoot again. 

Skill cooldown after usage: 10 seconds. (_currently bugged as during the 10 sec cooldown the player can still shoot the shotgun_)



**Implemented programming pattern: "Object pooling".**

Implementation: put the shootgun bullets that are shot in a container to re-use them again for next time the player shoots.
